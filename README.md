**To run:** \

 Build Observer.zip is the same but it includes the observer pattern implemented.

---
Simple game showcasing the use of singleton pattern for audio.
Pressing Space bar shows the fairy being activated, and as a result, speeding up the background music.

If the player falls off the platform, it uses observer pattern by informing the player and printing a debug line saying the player has fallen.
